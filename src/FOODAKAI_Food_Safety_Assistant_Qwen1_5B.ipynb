            "The problem is traced back to the presence of E. coli bacteria in the raw milk, which is a pathogenic microorganism. The production of raw milk cheese involves the use of milk, which is a source of E. coli. Therefore, the contamination of raw milk is the root cause of the E. coli contamination in the cheese. The production process, including the use of high-quality milk and proper processing, is essential to prevent such contamination. However, if there are issues in the production process, such as poor quality milk, incorrect processing, or lack of proper hygiene, it can lead to the introduction of E. coli into the cheese, resulting in the problem.\n",

            "The initial contamination of oysters by Norovirus was primarily due to environmental factors such as heavy rainfall before harvesting, which caused flooding and overflow of sewage treatment plants, leading to combined sewer overflow and faecal contamination. Additionally, cold weather in northern Europe during the first three months of 2010 contributed to the contamination of oysters by reducing the virus's survival in cold water temperatures.

Illness onset dates among these five case-patients ranged from June 6, 2012 to June 13, 2012. Two of the five case-patients were hospitalized.

From the context, I can see that the outbreak involved multiple states and provinces, with some countries like Canada and the US. The number of cases reported is 13, which is a moderate number.

            "Looking at the data provided, the outbreak involved 13 cases in the ACT from September 2021 to April 2022. The scale is moderate because it's not a small number (like 1-5) but also not a large number (like 10-15). The scale is moderate because it's a noticeable number but not overwhelming.\n",

This product is being recalled out of an abundance of caution due to the potential presence of Cronobacter sakazakii Importantly, no distributed product has tested positive for the presence of this bacteria, no adverse events have been reported and no other products manufactured at this facility or any other of Perrigo’s facilities are affected by this recall. Cronobacter sakazakii is a bacteria commonly found in the environment. In most people it causes no symptoms but in some, particularly premature infants, infants under 2 months of age or infants with weakened immune systems fever, poor feeding, excessive crying or low energy as well as other serious symptoms can occur. This product is sold at retailers across the U.S. Consumers who purchased the product after March 5, 2023 should look for the following Lot Codes and “use by” dates, which can be found on the bottom of the package. No other lot codes are impacted by this recall. Any consumers who purchased product with matching codes should discontinue use and dispose of the product.
